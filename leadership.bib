abstract = {In this paper, we propose that ethical leadership will lead to higher group in-role performance. Building from and integrating several different research streams, we argue that two key mechanisms for this effect are group conscientiousness (an emergent state) and group voice (a group process). We collected survey data at three points in time from 80 groups of nurses and the groups' leaders. The results provide support for all of our hypotheses. There was a positive relationship between employee ratings of ethical leadership (Time 1) and leader ratings of group in-role performance (Time 3). Group conscientiousness and group voice (Time 2) both partially mediated this relationship. These results contribute to our understanding of leadership and group effectiveness not only by showing that ethical leadership has a positive influence on group in-role performance, but also by identifying specific norms and group-level behaviors that help to account for this relationship.},

abstract = {An efficient protocol for the purification of pea seed-borne mosaic potyvirus (PSbMV) particles was developed. This led to the purification of 10 PSbMV isolates by a single procedure. Virus aggregation during purification did not occur and consequently, high virus yield was consistently obtained. The virus thus purified was suitable for preparing viral genomic RNA, although conventional methods for RNA extraction resulted in RNA degradation. An alternative method was adopted which yielded reproducibly full length and infectious RNA. This was applied to three isolates of PSbMV and the RNA used to direct complementary DNA synthesis which in turn yielded nearly full length cDNA products.},

abstract = {Aims. To examine a theoretical model testing the effects of authentic leadership, structural empowerment and relational social capital on the mental health and job satisfaction of new graduate nurses over the first year of practice. Background. Relational social capital is an important interpersonal organizational resource that may foster new graduate nurses' workplace wellbeing and promote retention. Evidence shows that authentic leadership and structural empowerment are key aspects of the work environment that support new graduate nurses; however, the mediating role of relational social capital has yet to be explored. Design. A longitudinal survey design was used to test the hypothesized model. Methods. One hundred ninety-one new graduate nurses in Ontario with {\textless}2 years of experience completed mail surveys in January–March 2010 and 1 year later in 2011. Path analysis using structural equation modelling was used to test the theoretical model. Results. Participants were mostly female, working full time in medicine/surgery or critical care. All measures demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. Path analysis results supported our hypothesized model; structural empowerment mediated the relationship between authentic leadership and nurses' relational social capital, which in turn had a negative effect on mental health symptoms and a positive effect on job satisfaction. All indirect paths in the model were significant. Conclusion. By creating structurally empowering work environments, authentic leaders foster relational social capital among new graduate nurses leading to positive health and retention outcomes.},

We also investigated how these leadership behaviors relate to effectiveness and optimism, using multiple-source ratings. Interviews with CEOs (N=73) were coded for the presence of leader's social responsibility and its facets. Also, using questionnaires, direct reports rated each CEOs' leader behavior (n=130) and a second group of direct reports (n=119) rated effectiveness and optimism. As expected, leaders high on social responsibility were rated higher on ethical leadership and lower on despotic leadership. Ethical leadership was also positively related to perceived top management team effectiveness and subordinates' optimism about the future of the organization and their own place within it.},

However, empirical research on ethical leader behaviour is limited and to date multilevel research is hardly found in this area. This study examines the relationships of two forms of perceived ethical leader behaviour (fairness and integrity and empowering behaviour) with subordinates' trust and commitment from a levels-of-analysis perspective, using within and between analysis (WABA). In total, 503 employees in 79 work groups rated their leader's fairness and integrity and empowering behaviour. Trust in management and co-workers, and subordinates' affective, continuance, and normative organizational commitment were also measured. As expected, perceived ethical leader behaviour was positively related to trust as well as affective and normative commitment and negatively to continuance commitment. Perceived empowering behaviour was more strongly related to affective commitment than perceived fairness and integrity. Perceptions of...},

This paper analyzes the differing ways in which respect has been treated within key leadership perspectives, identifying three differing types of respect, appraisal, recognition and identification respect. The antecedents or conditions that give rise to these three types of respect within the leadership relationship are identified. Drawing upon developments in the group behavior literature, the outcomes of appraisal and recognition respect in leadership are suggested. With the further addition of situational and individual factors that potentially moderate the relationship between respect and its antecedents, an integrated conceptual model of respect in leadership is presented to underpin future research in the area.},

abstract = {A panel study with two points of measurement throughout a four-month interval (N = 189) in the context of a socio-political organization was conducted to examine the role of collective identity in mediating the relationship between perceived respect and organizational participation. Path analyses confirmed that the effect of perceived respect at Time 1 on organizational participation at Time 2 was fully mediated by the cognitive component of collective identity (`importance-to-identity'). Interestingly, although perceived respect at Time 1 also had a significant effect on the evaluative component of collective identity (`private collective self-esteem'), this component was not involved in the mediation. Including perceived individual benefits as statistical controls in the model did not change this picture. In fact, with regard to the link between perceived benefits and participation results also point to a mediating role of the cognitive component of collective identity. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Although transformational leadership has been studied extensively, the magnitude of the relationship between transformational leadership and follower performance across criterion types and levels of analysis remains unclear. Based on 117 independent samples over 113 primary studies, the current meta-analytic study showed that transformational leadership was positively related to individual-level follower performance across criterion types, with a stronger relationship for contextual performance than for task performance across most study settings. In addition, transformational leadership was positively related to performance at the team and organization levels. Moreover, both meta-analytic regression and relative importance analyses consistently showed that transformational leadership had an augmentation effect over transactional leadership (contingent reward) in predicting individual-level contextual performance and team-level performance. Contrary to our expectation, however, no augmentation effect of transformational leadership over contingent reward was found in predicting individual-level task performance. Instead, contingent reward explained incremental variance in individual-level task performance beyond that explained by transformational leadership.},

abstract = {Organizational scholars have invoked the concept of respect and relegated it as a common sense, under-specified construct. This article analyzes the notion of respect by drawing on philosophy and defines respectful behavior as the manifestation of believing another person has value. Two types of respect are identified: appraisal respect is based on individual characteristics, and recognition respect is based on being human and having rights. In the organizational context, appraisal respect is acknowledgement of work performance and recognition respect is the quality of interpersonal treatment. This article presents a new theoretical framework that juxtaposes these two types of respect to model how they have different effects on self-esteem and therefore affect attitudes and behaviors differently. This model allows future research in the organization sciences to invoke respect more precisely, especially organizational justice and leadership research that explicitly or implicitly use concepts of respect.},

Moreover, the studies demonstrated that social identity explains the impact of other factors that have previously been linked to extrarole behavior. In particular, the findings indicate that social identity mediates the effect of procedural justice judgments and economic outcomes on supervisor ratings of extrarole behavior.

We propose social learning theory as a theoretical basis for understanding ethical leadership and offer a constitutive definition of the ethical leadership construct. In seven interlocking studies, we investigate the viability and importance of this construct. We develop and test a new instrument to measure ethical leadership, examine the proposed connections of ethical leadership with other constructs in a nomological network, and demonstrate its predictive validity for important employee outcomes. Specifically, ethical leadership is related to consideration behavior, honesty, trust in the leader, interactional fairness, socialized charismatic leadership (as measured by the idealized influence dimension of transformational leadership), and abusive supervision, but is not subsumed by any of these. Finally, ethical leadership predicts outcomes such as perceived effectiveness of leaders, followers' job satisfaction and dedication, and their willingness to report problems to management.},

abstract = {Background: New nurse burnout has personal and organizational costs. The combined effect of authentic leadership, person-job fit within areas of worklife, and occupational coping self-efficacy on new nurses' burnout and emotional wellbeing has not been investigated. Objectives: This study tested a model linking authentic leadership, areas of worklife, occupational coping self-efficacy, burnout, and mental health among new graduate nurses. We also tested the validity of the concept of interpersonal strain at work as a facet of burnout. Design: A cross-sectional national survey of Canadian new graduate nurses was conducted. Participants: Registered nurses working in direct patient care in acute care settings with less than 3 years of experience were selected from provincial registry databases of 10 Canadian provinces. A total of 1009 of 3743 surveyed new graduate nurses were included in the final sample (useable response rate 27{\%}). Methods: Participants received a mail survey package that included a letter of information, study questionnaire, and a {\$}2 coffee voucher. To optimize response rates non-responders received a reminder letter four weeks after the initial mailing, followed by a second survey package four weeks after that. Ethics approval was obtained from the university ethics board prior to starting the study. Descriptive statistics and scale reliabilities were analyzed. Structural equation modelling with maximum likelihood estimation was used to test the fit between the data and the hypothesized model and to assess the factor structure of the expanded burnout measure. Results: The hypothesized model was an acceptable fit for the data (??2 (164)=1221.38; ??2 ratio=7.447; CFI=.921; IFI=.921; RMSEA=.08). All hypothesized paths were significant. Authentic leadership had a positive effect on areas of worklife, which in turn had a positive effect on occupational coping self-efficacy, resulting in lower burnout, which was associated with poor mental health. Conclusions: Authentic leaders may play an important role in creating positive working conditions and strengthening new nurses' confidence that help them cope with job demands, thereby protecting them from developing burnout and poor mental health. Leadership training to develop supervisors' authentic leadership skills may promote the development of person-job fit, thereby increasing occupational self-efficacy and new nurses' wellbeing.},

abstract = {Background:Authentic leadership (AL) is a kind of leadership that inspires and promotes positive psychological capacities, underlining the moral and ethical component of behavior The proposed investigation studies the relations among AL, cohesion, and group identification in security and emergency teams. Method: A cross-sectional research design was conducted in which participated 221 members from 26 fire departments and operative teams from the local police of three Spanish provinces. The following questionnaires were administered: Authentic Leadership(ALQ), Group Cohesion (GEQ), and Mael and Ashford's Group Identification Questionnaire. Results: A direct and positive relation was found between AL, cohesion, and group identification. An indirect relation was also found between AL and group cohesion through group identification, indicating the existence of partial mediation. Conclusions: The utility of the proposed model based on AL is considered; this model can be employed by those in charge of the fire departments and operative groups in organizations to improve workteams' cohesion. Both AL and group identification help to explain group cohesion in organizations committed to security and emergencies. },

abstract = {Guided by both social cognitive and identity-based perspectives of leadership, the present study investigated how and when the process of leader categorization results in greater leader effectiveness. Specifically, we propose that the relationship between leader categorization and subordinates' openness toward leadership should be partially mediated by subordinates' identification with their leaders. Furthermore, seeking to corroborate that the issue of self-esteem is the central ingredient in the identification process, we argue that the mediation should become weaker the more subordinates feel that they are being treated disrespectfully by their leaders, and thus are explicitly undermined in their efforts toward self-enhancement. The proposed mediating effect was tested and supported in two field studies (N1 = 244, N2 = 645). In the second study, we also tested and found support for the proposed moderated mediation model. The theoretical and managerial consequences are discussed.},

In Study 1, structural equation modeling indicated that pride and respect related to the intent to remain a volunteer with an organization, and that this relation was mediated primarily by normative organizational commitment. In Study 2, structural equation modeling indicated that the perceived importance of volunteer work was related to pride, that perceived organizational support related to the experience of respect, and that pride and respect mediated the relation between perceived importance and support on the one hand and organizational commitment on the other. Overall, the results suggest that volunteer organizations may do well to implement pride and respect in their volunteer policy, for instance to address the reliability problem (J. L. Pearce, 1993).},

Three categories of leader emotional displays are identified: surface acting, deep acting and genuine emotions. The consistency of expressed leader emotions with affective display rules, together with the type of display chosen, combines to impact the leader's felt authenticity, the favorability of follower impressions, and the perceived authenticity of the leader by the followers. Emotional intelligence, self-monitoring ability, and political skill are proposed as individual differences that moderate leader emotional display responses to affective events. We also look at followers' trust in the leader and leader well-being as key outcomes. Finally, we explore the influence on leader emotional labor of contextual dimensions of the environment, including the omnibus (national and organizational culture, industry and occupation, organizational structure, time) and discrete (situational) context.

On the applied side, however, the extant research does not offer many insights as to which concrete leadership behaviors are perceived by employees as indications of respectful leadership. Thus, to offer such insights, we collected and content analyzed employees' narrations of encounters with respectful leadership (N (1) = 426). The coding process resulted in 19 categories of respectful leadership spanning 149 leadership behaviors. Furthermore, to also harness this comprehensive repertoire for quantitative organizational research, we undertook two more studies (N (2a) = 228; N (2b) = 412) to empirically derive a feasible item-based measurement of respectful leadership and assess its psychometric qualities. In these studies, we additionally investigated the relationships between respectful leadership as assessed with this new measurement and employees' vertical and contextual followership as assessed via subordinates' identification with their leaders, their appraisal respect for their leaders, their feeling of self-determination, and their job satisfaction.},

The match between the two ultimately determines how favourably subordinates respond towards leaders. The respective research, however, yields some confusion as to what kind of prototype is exactly used in this process. Are leaders matched against a central tendency leader prototype, i.e. to an average image of leaders in general, or is it subordinates' goal-directed leader prototype, i.e. their image of an ideal leader, that leaders have to live up to? We reanalysed a field study (N = 266) and conducted a second one likewise with employees (N = 271) to contrast the relevance of both prototypes. The analyses reveal that only the match with the ideal leader prototype was predictive of subordinates' responses towards their leaders. Previous central tendency leader categorization research thus might have pertained to the ideal aspects in the existing leader population.},
