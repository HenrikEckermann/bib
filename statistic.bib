abstract = {Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a comprehensive manual for the applied researcher who wants to perform data analysis using linear and nonlinear regression and multilevel models. The book introduces a wide variety of models, whilst at the same time instructing the reader in how to fit these models using available software packages. The book illustrates the concepts by working through scores of real data examples that have arisen from the authors' own applied research, with programming codes provided for each one. Topics covered include causal inference, including regression, poststratification, matching, regression discontinuity, and instrumental variables, as well as multilevel logistic regression and missing-data imputation. Practical tips regarding building, fitting, and understanding are provided throughout. Author resource page: http://www.stat.columbia.edu/{\~{}}gelman/arm/},

@book{Tabachnick2007,
abstract = {(from the cover) Using Multivariate Statistics provides advanced students with a timely statistical and multivariate techniques, while assuming only a limited knowledge of higher-level mathematics. This long-awaited revision reflects extensive updates throughout, especially in the areas of Data Screening (Chapter 4), Multiple Regression (Chapter 5), and Logistic Regression (Chapter 12). A brand new chapter (Chapter 15) on Multilevel Linear Modeling explains techniques for dealing with hierarchical data sets. Also included are syntax and output for accomplishing many analyses through the most recent releases of SAS and SPSS. As in past editions, each technique chapter (1) discusses tests for assumptions of analysis (and procedures for dealing with their violation), (2) presents a small example, hand-worked for the most basic analysis, (3) describes varieties of analysis, (4) discusses important issues (such as effect size), and (5) provides an example with a real data set from tests of assumptions to write-up of a results section.
