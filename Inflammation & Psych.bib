abstract = {BACKGROUND: Major depression occurs in 4.4{\%} to 20{\%} of the general population. Studies suggest that major depression is accompanied by immune dysregulation and activation of the inflammatory response system (IRS). Our objective was to quantitatively summarize the data on concentrations of specific cytokines in patients diagnosed with a major depressive episode and controls. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of studies measuring cytokine concentration in patients with major depression, with a database search of the English literature (to August 2009) and a manual search of references. RESULTS: Twenty-four studies involving unstimulated measurements of cytokines in patients meeting DSM criteria for major depression were included in the meta-analysis; 13 for tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, 9 for interleukin (IL)-1beta, 16 for IL-6, 5 for IL-4, 5 for IL-2, 4 for IL-8, 6 for IL-10, and 4 for interferon (IFN)-gamma. There were significantly higher concentrations of TNF-alpha (p {\textless} .00001), weighted mean difference (WMD) (95{\%} confidence interval) 3.97 pg/mL (2.24 to 5.71), in depressed subjects compared with control subjects (438 depressed/350 nondepressed). Also, IL-6 concentrations were significantly higher (p {\textless} .00001) in depressed subjects compared with control subjects (492 depressed/400 nondepressed) with an overall WMD of 1.78 pg/mL (1.23 to 2.33). There were no significant differences among depressed and nondepressed subjects for the other cytokines studied. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis reports significantly higher concentrations of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6 in depressed subjects compared with control subjects. While both positive and negative results have been reported in individual studies, this meta-analytic result strengthens evidence that depression is accompanied by activation of the IRS.},

abstract = {Background: The inflammatory hypothesis of schizophrenia is not new, but recently it has regained interest as more data suggest a role of the immune system in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. If increased inflammation of the brain contributes to the symptoms of schizophrenia, reduction of the inflammatory status could improve the clinical picture. Lately, several trials have been conducted investigating the potential of anti-inflammatory agents to improve symptoms of schizophrenia. This study provides an update regarding the efficacy of anti-inflammatory agents on schizophrenic symptoms in clinical studies performed so far. Methods: An electronic search was performed using PubMed, Embase, the national institutes of Health Web site clinicaltirals. gov, Cochrane Schizophrenia Group entries in PsiTri http://psitri.stakes.fi/EN/psitri.htm), and the Cochrane Database of systematic reviews. Only randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled studies that investigated clinical outcome (PANSS) were included. Results: Our search yielded 26 double blind RCTs that provided information on the efficacy on symptom severity of the following components: aspirin, celecoxib, davunetide, EPA/DHA fatty-acids, estrogens, minocycline and N-acetylcysteine (NAC). Of these components aspirin [mean weighted effect size (ES) 0.3, 95{\%} CI 0.06-0.537, I2 = 0], estrogens (ES 0.51, 95{\%} CI 0.043- 0.972, I2 = 69{\%}) and NAC (0.45, 95{\%} CI 0.112-0.779) showed significant effects. Celecoxib, minocycline, davunetide and fatty acids showed no significant effect. Conclusion: The results of aspirin addition to antipsychotic treatment seem promising, as does the addition of NAC and estrogens. These three agents are all very broadly active substances and it has to be investigated if the beneficial effects on symptom severity are indeed mediated by their anti-inflammatory aspects.},

abstract = {Serum levels of inflammatory cytokines, for example, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF$\alpha$), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-1 beta (IL-1$\beta$), are elevated in subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reason why this occurs is unclear. Elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines could be a result of brain dysfunction in MDD. It is also possible that inflammatory cytokines contribute to depressive symptoms in MDD. If the first assumption is correct, one would expect levels to normalize with resolution of the depressive episode after treatment. Several studies have measured changes in cytokine levels during antidepressant treatment; however, the results vary. The purpose of this study was to pool all available data on changes in serum levels of TNF$\alpha$, IL-6, and IL-1$\beta$ during antidepressant treatment to determine whether these levels change. Studies were included if they used an approved pharmacological treatment for depression, patients had a diagnosis of MDD, and serum levels of TNF$\alpha$, IL-6, and/or IL-1$\beta$ were measured before and after treatment. Twenty-two studies fulfilled these criteria. Meta-analysis of these studies showed that, overall, while pharmacological antidepressant treatment reduced depressive symptoms, it did not reduce serum levels of TNF$\alpha$. On the other hand, antidepressant treatment did reduce levels of IL-1$\beta$ and possibly those of IL-6. Stratified subgroup analysis by class of antidepressant indicated that serotonin reuptake inhibitors may reduce levels of IL-6 and TNF$\alpha$. Other antidepressants, while efficacious for depressive symptoms, did not appear to reduce cytokine levels. These results argue against the notion that resolution of a depressive episode is associated with normalization of levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines; however, the results are consistent with the possibility that inflammatory cytokines contribute to depressive symptoms and that antidepressants block the effects of inflammatory cytokines on the brain.},

abstract = {Due to the unique opportunity to assess individuals before and after they develop depression within a short timeframe, interferon-alpha (IFN-$\alpha$) treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is an ideal model to identify molecular mechanisms relevant to major depression, especially in the context of enhanced inflammation. 58 patients were assessed prospectively, at baseline and monthly over 24-weeks of IFN-$\alpha$. New onset cases of depression were determined using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Whole blood transcriptomic analyses were conducted to investigate: 1) baseline gene expression differences associated with future development of IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression, before IFN-$\alpha$; and 2) longitudinal gene expression changes from baseline to weeks 4 or 24 of IFN-$\alpha$, separately in those who did and did not develop depression. Transcriptomics data were analysed using Partek Genomics Suite (1.4-fold, FDR adjusted p0.05) and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis Software. Twenty patients (34{\%}) developed IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression. At baseline, 73 genes were differentially expressed in patients who later developed depression compared with those who did not. After 4 weeks of IFN-$\alpha$, 592 genes were modulated in the whole sample, representing primarily IFN-$\alpha$ -responsive genes. Substantially more genes were modulated only in patients who developed depression (n=506, compared with n=70 in patients who did not), with enrichment in inflammation-, neuroplasticity- and oxidative stress-related pathways. A similar picture was observed at week 24. Our data indicate that patients who develop IFN-$\alpha$-induced depression have an increased biological sensitivity to IFN-$\alpha$, as shown by larger gene expression changes, and specific signatures both as predictors and as correlates.},

The severity of the manic episodes was assessed according to the Young mania rating scale. TNF-??, INF-??, IL-6 and hs-CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with manic episode of bipolar I disorder before treatment than HS. After treatment the levels of TNF-??, INF-??, IL-6 and hs-CRP were observed to be significantly decreased. There was no difference between the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines in patients before or after treatment of bipolar disorder and HS. hs-CRP was observed to be the only parameter correlated with clinical response. The most significant outcome of this study is the correlation between clinical outcome and hs-CRP levels in treatment naive manic episode bipolar type I patients. hs-CRP is the most consistent indicator according to pro-inflammatory, inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, in predicting treatment outcomes.},

@article{Benros2011,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Autoimmune diseases have been associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia. It has been suggested that brain-reactive autoantibodies are part of the mechanisms behind this association. Furthermore, an increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier has been observed during periods of infection and inflammation. The authors therefore investigated whether autoimmune diseases combined with exposures to severe infections may increase the risk of schizophrenia

METHOD: Nationwide population-based registers in Denmark were linked, and the data were analyzed in a cohort study using survival analysis. All analyses were adjusted for calendar year, age, and sex. Incidence rate ratios and accompanying 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) as measures of relative risk were used.

RESULTS: A prior autoimmune disease increased the risk of schizophrenia by 29{\%} (incidence rate ratio=1.29; 95{\%} CI=1.18-1.41). Any history of hospitalization with infection increased the risk of schizophrenia by 60{\%} (incidence rate ratio=1.60; 95{\%} CI=1.56-1.64). When the two risk factors were combined, the risk of schizophrenia was increased even further (incidence rate ratio=2.25; 95{\%} CI=2.04-2.46). The risk of schizophrenia was increased in a dose-response relationship, where three or more infections and an autoimmune disease were associated with an incidence rate ratio of 3.40 (95{\%} CI=2.91-3.94). The results remained significant after adjusting for substance use disorders and family history of psychiatric disorders. Hospital contact with infection occurred in nearly 24{\%} of individuals prior to a schizophrenia diagnosis.

CONCLUSIONS: Autoimmune disease and the number of infections requiring hospitalization are risk factors for schizophrenia. The increased risk is compatible with an immunological hypothesis in subgroups of schizophrenia patients.},

@article{Slavich2014,
abstract = {Major life stressors, especially those involving interpersonal stress and social rejection, are among the strongest proximal risk factors for depression. In this review, we propose a biologically plausible, multilevel theory that describes neural, physiologic, molecular, and genomic mechanisms that link experiences of social-environmental stress with internal biological processes that drive depression pathogenesis. Central to this social signal transduction theory of depression is the hypothesis that experiences of social threat and adversity up-regulate components of the immune system involved in inflammation. The key mediators of this response, called proinflammatory cytokines, can in turn elicit profound changes in behavior, which include the initiation of depressive symptoms such as sad mood, anhedonia, fatigue, psychomotor retardation, and social-behavioral withdrawal. This highly conserved biological response to adversity is critical for survival during times of actual physical threat or injury. However, this response can also be activated by modern-day social, symbolic, or imagined threats, leading to an increasingly proinflammatory phenotype that may be a key phenomenon driving depression pathogenesis and recurrence, as well as the overlap of depression with several somatic conditions including asthma, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic pain, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, obesity, and neurodegeneration. Insights from this theory may thus shed light on several important questions including how depression develops, why it frequently recurs, why it is strongly predicted by early life stress, and why it often co-occurs with symptoms of anxiety and with certain physical disease conditions. This work may also suggest new opportunities for preventing and treating depression by targeting inflammation.},

We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the magnitude and direction of associations of depression with C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-1, and IL-6 in community and clinical samples. METHODS: Systematic review of articles published between January 1967 and January 2008 in the PubMed and PsycINFO electronic databases was performed. Effect sizes were calculated as stat d and meta-analyzed, using random-effects models. RESULTS: Each inflammatory marker was positively associated with depression; CRP, d = 0.15 (95{\%} CI = 0.10, 0.21), p {\textless} .001; IL-6, d = 0.25 (95{\%} CI = 0.18, 0.31), p {\textless} .001; IL-1, d = 0.35 (95{\%} CI = 0.03, 0.67), p = .03; IL-1ra, d = 0.25 (95{\%} CI = 0.04, 0.46), p = .02. Associations were strongest in clinically depressed patient samples--but were also significant in community-based samples--and when clinical interviews were used. Studies adjusting for body mass index (BMI) had smaller associations, albeit significant. Relationships were inconsistent with respect to age, medication, and sex. Depression was related to CRP and IL-6 among patients with cardiac disease or cancer. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and CRP, IL-1, and IL-6 are positively associated in clinical and community samples and BMI is implicated as a mediating/moderating factor. Continuity in clinic- and community-based samples suggests there is a dose-response relationship between depression and these inflammatory markers, lending strength to the contention that the cardiac (or cancer) risk conferred by depression is not exclusive to patient populations. Available evidence is consistent with three causal pathways: depression to inflammation, inflammation to depression, and bidirectional relationships.},

abstract = {Inflammation and altered glutamate metabolism are two pathways implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. Interestingly, these pathways may be linked given that administration of inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-$\alpha$ to otherwise non-depressed controls increased glutamate in the basal ganglia and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Whether increased inflammation is associated with increased glutamate among patients with major depression is unknown. Accordingly, we conducted a cross-sectional study of 50 medication-free, depressed outpatients using single-voxel MRS, to measure absolute glutamate concentrations in basal ganglia and dACC. Multivoxel chemical shift imaging (CSI) was used to explore creatine-normalized measures of other metabolites in basal ganglia. Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) inflammatory markers were assessed along with anhedonia and psychomotor speed. Increased log plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) was significantly associated with increased log left basal ganglia glutamate controlling for age, sex, race, body mass index, smoking status and depression severity. In turn, log left basal ganglia glutamate was associated with anhedonia and psychomotor slowing measured by the finger-tapping test, simple reaction time task and the Digit Symbol Substitution Task. Plasma CRP was not associated with dACC glutamate. Plasma and CSF CRP were also associated with CSI measures of basal ganglia glutamate and the glial marker myoinositol. These data indicate that increased inflammation in major depression may lead to increased glutamate in the basal ganglia in association with glial dysfunction and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting glutamate may be preferentially effective in depressed patients with increased inflammation as measured by CRP.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 12 January 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.206.},

abstract = {Background: Many studies have explored the association between soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R), cytokines and major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the results of these studies were not consistent. The aim of our study is to compare the levels of sIL-2R and cytokines in the blood between MDD patients and controls by a meta-analysis and to identify moderators accounting for potential heterogeneity in the levels of sIL-2R and cytokines in MDD patients versus controls by meta-regression analyses. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify studies comparing the levels of sIL-2R and cytokines between MDD patients and controls. We pooled the effect sizes for standardized mean differences (SMD) of the levels of sIL-2R and cytokines. We also performed meta-regression and sensitivity analyses to investigate the roles of age, gender, sample type, ethnic origin and selected studies' quality in explaining potential heterogeneity and differences in results respectively. Results: Twenty-nine studies were selected for this analysis. The levels of sIL-2R, TNF-?? and IL-6 in MDD patients were significantly higher than those of healthy controls (SMD = 0.555, p {\textless} 0.001, SMD = 0.567, p = 0.010; SMD = 0.680, p {\textless} 0.001). Mean age of all subjects was a significant moderator to explain the high heterogeneity of IL-6. Sensitivity analysis found that European but not non-European subjects have higher levels difference of sIL-2R, TNF-?? and IL-1?? between MDD patients and controls. Limitation: The severity of MDD was not considered. Conclusion: The blood levels of sIL-2R, TNF-?? and IL-6 were significantly higher in MDD patients than controls. Age, samples source and ethnic origins may play a potential role in heterogeneity. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Converging sources of evidence point to a role for inflammation in the development of depression, fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. More precisely, the tryptophan (TRP) catabolism is thought to play a major role in inflammation-induced depression. Mastocytosis is a rare disease in which chronic symptoms, including depression, are related to mast cell accumulation and activation. Our objectives were to study the correlations between neuropsychiatric features and the TRP catabolism pathway in mastocytosis in order to demonstrate mast cells' potential involvement in inflammation-induced depression. Fifty-four patients with mastocytosis and a mean age of 50.1 years were enrolled in the study and compared healthy age-matched controls. Depression and stress were evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory revised and the Perceived Stress Scale. All patients had measurements of TRP, serotonin (5-HT), kynurenine (KYN), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) activity (ratio KYN/TRP), kynurenic acid (KA) and quinolinic acid (QA). Patients displayed significantly lower levels of TRP and 5-HT without hypoalbuminemia or malabsorption, higher IDO1 activity, and higher levels of KA and QA, with an imbalance towards the latter. High perceived stress and high depression scores were associated with low TRP and high IDO1 activity. In conclusion, TRP metabolism is altered in mastocytosis and correlates with perceived stress and depression, demonstrating mast cells' involvement in inflammation pathways linked to depression.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 26 January 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2015.216.},

Cognitive decline associated with aging, and white matter connectivity degradation as a biological substrate for that decline, is then described. We then briefly describe the technology of DTI as a means for in vivo, non-invasive interrogation of white matter connectivity, and relate it to FLAIR, a more traditional MRI method for assessing white matter injury. We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {Epidemiological evidence for the inflammatory hypothesis of depression is largely cross-sectional; people with depression have elevated levels of circulating pro-inflammatory markers compared to people without depression. The limitation of cross sectional research is the potential for extraneous factors to influence observed effects. The purpose of this meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies of interleukin(IL)-6 and IL-10 in people with and without depression is to provide a targeted analysis of potential moderator factors relating to the diagnosis of depression and to physical and psychiatric comorbidity. Electronic searches of Embase and Medline databases were conducted using subject headings " interleukin-6" or " interleukin-10" and those relating to depression. Studies were included if they measured circulating marker levels in serum or plasma in a group of people with and without depressive symptoms (99 studies for IL-6, 19 studies for IL-10). IL-6 was elevated in depressed compared to non-depressed groups (d=0.46, 99{\%} CI 0.34 to 0.58, I2=85.9{\%}). This effect was larger in subgroups where depressive disorders were diagnosed compared to those with only depressive symptoms via standardized inventory, and subgroups where participants were recruited from inpatient or outpatient settings compared to the general community. The effect was also larger in those who were not selected for a particular comorbidity compared to those selected for cardiovascular disease. IL-10 effect size was not significant (d=-0.31, 99{\%} CI -0.95 to 0.32, I2=94.1{\%}) which was not accounted for in subgroup analyses or meta-regression, indicating there is not a global elevation in cytokines. These data highlight that comorbidity and behavioral aspects of depression need to be measured and controlled in future prospective and experimental research testing the inflammatory hypothesis of depression. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Patients with bipolar disorder are known to be at high risk of premature death. Comorbid cardio-vascular diseases are a leading cause of excess mortality, well above the risk associated with suicide. In this review, we explore comorbid medical disorders, highlighting evidence that bipolar disorder can be effectively conceptualized as a multi-systemic inflammatory disease.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic PubMed search of all English-language articles recently published with bipolar disorder cross-referenced with the following terms: mortality and morbidity, cardio-vascular, diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, inflammation, auto-antibody, retro-virus, stress, sleep and circadian rhythm.

RESULTS: Evidence gathered so far suggests that the multi-system involvement is present from the early stages, and therefore requires proactive screening and diagnostic procedures, as well as comprehensive treatment to reduce progression and premature mortality. Exploring the biological pathways that could account for the observed link show that dysregulated inflammatory background could be a common factor underlying cardio-vascular and bipolar disorders. Viewing bipolar disorder as a multi-system disorder should help us to re-conceptualize disorders of the mind as "disorders of the brain and the body".

LIMITATIONS: The current literature substantially lacks longitudinal and mechanistic studies, as well as comparison studies to explore the magnitude of the medical burden in bipolar disorder compared to major mood disorders as well as psychotic disorders. It is also necessary to look for subgroups of bipolar disorder based on their rates of comorbid disorders.

CONCLUSIONS: Comorbid medical illnesses in bipolar disorder might be viewed not only as the consequence of health behaviors and of psychotropic medications, but rather as an early manifestation of a multi-systemic disorder. Medical monitoring is thus a critical component of case assessment. Exploring common biological pathways of inflammation should help biomarkers discovery, ultimately leading to innovative diagnostic tools, new methods of prevention and personalized treatments.},

@article{Shelton2010,
abstract = {Obesity and related metabolic conditions are of epidemic proportions in most of the world, affecting both adults and children. The accumulation of lipids in the body in the form of white adipose tissue in the abdomen is now known to activate innate immune mechanisms. Lipid accumulation causes adipocytes to directly secrete the cytokines interleukin (IL) 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), but also monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), which results in the accumulation of leukocytes in fat tissue. This sets up a chronic inflammatory state which is known to mediate the association between obesity and conditions such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. There is also a substantial literature linking inflammation with risk for depression. This includes the observations that: (1) people with inflammatory diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cardiovascular disease, and psoriasis have elevated rates of depression; (2) many people administered inflammatory cytokines such as interferon alpha develop depression that is indistinguishable from depression in non-medically ill populations; (3) a significant proportion of depressed persons show upregulation of inflammatory factors such as IL-6, C-reactive protein, and TNFalpha; (4) inflammatory cytokines can interact with virtually every pathophysiologic domain relevant to depression, including neurotransmitter metabolism, neuroendocrine function, and synaptic plasticity. While many factors may contribute to the association between inflammatory mediators and depression, we hypothesize that increased adiposity may be one causal pathway. Mediational analysis suggests a bi-directional association between adiposity and depression, with inflammation possibly playing an intermediary role.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Inflammatory cytokines are implicated in the pathophysiology of depression. In rodents, systemically administered inflammatory cytokines induce depression-like behavior. Similarly in humans, therapeutic interferon-alpha induces clinical depression in a third of patients. Conversely, patients with depression also show elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines.

OBJECTIVES: To determine the neural mechanisms underlying inflammation-associated mood change and modulatory effects on circuits involved in mood homeostasis and affective processing.

METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized crossover study, 16 healthy male volunteers received typhoid vaccination or saline (placebo) injection in two experimental sessions. Mood questionnaires were completed at baseline and at 2 and 3 hours. Two hours after injection, participants performed an implicit emotional face perception task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. Analyses focused on neurobiological correlates of inflammation-associated mood change and affective processing within regions responsive to emotional expressions and implicated in the etiology of depression.

RESULTS: Typhoid but not placebo injection produced an inflammatory response indexed by increased circulating interleukin-6 and significant mood reduction at 3 hours. Inflammation-associated mood deterioration correlated with enhanced activity within subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) (a region implicated in the etiology of depression) during emotional face processing. Furthermore, inflammation-associated mood change reduced connectivity of sACC to amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and superior temporal sulcus, which was modulated by peripheral interleukin-6.

CONCLUSIONS: Inflammation-associated mood deterioration is reflected in changes in sACC activity and functional connectivity during evoked responses to emotional stimuli. Peripheral cytokines modulate this mood-dependent sACC connectivity, suggesting a common pathophysiological basis for major depressive disorder and sickness-associated mood change and depression.},

abstract = {Exercise is an efficacious treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) and has independently been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in non-depressed subjects. Patients with MDD have elevated inflammatory cytokines but it is not known if exercise affects inflammation in MDD patients and whether these changes are clinically relevant. In the TReatment with Exercise Augmentation for Depression (TREAD) study, participants who were partial responders to a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor were randomized to receive one of two doses of exercise: 16 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight per week (KKW), or 4 KKW for 12 weeks. Blood samples were collected before initiation and again at the end of the 12-week exercise intervention. Serum was analyzed using a multiplexed ELISA for interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN-$\gamma$), interleukin-1$\beta$ (IL-1$\beta$), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$). Higher baseline levels of TNF-$\alpha$ were associated with greater decrease in depression symptoms over the 12-week exercise period (P{\textless}0.0001). In addition, a significant positive correlation between change in IL-1$\beta$ and change in depression symptom scores was observed (P=0.04). There were no significant changes in mean level of any cytokine following the 12-week intervention, and no significant relationship between exercise dose and change in mean cytokine level. Results suggest that high TNF-$\alpha$ may differentially predict better outcomes with exercise treatment as opposed to antidepressant medications for which high TNF-$\alpha$ is linked to poor response. Our results also confirm findings from studies of antidepressant medications that tie decreasing IL-1$\beta$ to positive depression treatment outcomes.},

abstract = {Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are widely used in treating depressive disorders. It has been demonstrated that, for instance, IL-1 beta and IL-6 inhibit the HPA axis, which plays a role in the development of depressions. Therefore. we were interested in investigating how TCAs influence cytokine release by T lymphocytes and monocytes respectively. Cells were incubated with either 5 microM clomipramine, 15 microM imipramine or 20 microM citalopram. IL-2 release was suppressed to 60{\%} of the control values by clomipramine and imipramine (p = 0.001; p = 0.000), but citalopram was found to cause a much weaker inhibition (only 18{\%}) (p = 0.16). INF-gamma release was affected to a lower degree than IL-2 release, and imipramine (34{\%}) (p = 0.054) was more potent than clomipramine (24{\%}) (p = 0.16) and citalopram (12{\%}) (p = 0.059) in this case. Monocytes incubated with TCA for 4 h exhibited only limited inhibition of IL-1 beta and IL-6 release, i.e., 6-25{\%} for all three compounds. The corresponding value for TNF-alpha release was 20-45{\%} inhibition, with citalopram being the weakest inhibitor. After 10 h of monocytes to LPS exposure, all three compounds exerted a strong inhibition of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha release, i.e., 60-70{\%} with p-values below 0.012 for all of them. However the inhibition of IL-6 release was less than 35{\%}. Citalopram was equality as potent as imipramine and clomipramine in inhibiting IL-6 release after long-term exposure of monocytes to LPS. All three TCAs elevated intracellular cAMP concentrations significantly in T lymphocytes and monocytes (p {\textless} 0.001).},

abstract = {Neurologists and psychiatrists frequently encounter patients whose central and/or peripheral neurologic and/or psychiatric symptoms (NPS) are accompanied by other symptoms for which investigation finds no unifying cause and for which empiric therapy often provides little to no benefit. Systemic mast cell activation disease (MCAD) has rarely been considered in the differential diagnosis in such situations. Traditionally, MCAD has been considered as just one rare (neoplastic) disease, mastocytosis, generally focusing on the mast cell (MC) mediators tryptase and histamine and the suggestive, blatant symptoms of flushing and anaphylaxis. Recently another form of MCAD, MC activation syndrome (MC), has been recognized, featuring inappropriate MC activation with little to no neoplasia and likely much more heterogeneously clonal and far more prevalent than mastocytosis. There also has developed greater appreciation for the truly very large menagerie of MC mediators and their complex patterns of release, engendering complex, nebulous presentations of chronic and acute illness best characterized as multisystem polymorbidity of generally inflammatory ?? allergic themes - including very wide arrays of central and peripheral NPS. Significantly helpful treatment - including for neuropsychiatric issues - usually can be identified once MCAD is accurately diagnosed. We describe MCAD's pathogenesis, presentation (focusing on NPS), and therapy, especially vis-??-vis neuropsychotropes. Since MCAD patients often present NPS, neurologists and psychiatrists have the opportunity, in recognizing the diagnostic possibility of MCAD, to short-circuit the often decades-long delay in establishing the correct diagnosis required to identify optimal therapy.},

abstract = {In response to a peripheral infection, innate immune cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that act on the brain to cause sickness behaviour. When activation of the peripheral immune system continues unabated, such as during systemic infections, cancer or autoimmune diseases, the ensuing immune signalling to the brain can lead to an exacerbation of sickness and the development of symptoms of depression in vulnerable individuals. These phenomena might account for the increased prevalence of clinical depression in physically ill people. Inflammation is therefore an important biological event that might increase the risk of major depressive episodes, much like the more traditional psychosocial factors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: About 40{\%} of patients with limbic encephalitis do not have detectable CNS antibodies. Some of these patients have immune-mediated limbic encephalitis, but their frequency is unknown.

AIMS: (1) To determine the spectrum of limbic encephalitis identified on clinical grounds in a single institution, and compare it with that in patients referred for antibody analysis. (2) To correlate clinical outcomes with the cellular location of the autoantigens.

METHODS: Prospective clinical case studies. Immunohistochemistry with rat brain, live hippocampal neurones, HeLa cells expressing Kv potassium channels and immunoblot.

RESULTS: In 4 years, 17 patients were identified in the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, USA, and the serum or CSF samples of 22 patients diagnosed elsewhere were also studied. 9 of our 17 (53{\%}) patients had antibodies to known neuronal antigens (paraneoplastic or voltage gated potassium channels (VGKCs)) and 5 (29{\%}) to novel cell-membrane antigens (nCMAg) typically expressed in the hippocampus and sometimes in the cerebellum. Considering the entire series, 19 of 39 (49{\%}) patients had antibodies to known antigens, and 17 (44{\%}) to nCMAg. Follow-up (2-48 months, median 19 months) was available for 35 patients. When compared with patients with antibodies to intraneuronal antigens, a significant association with response to treatment was found in those with antibodies to cell-membrane antigens in general (VGKC or nCMAg, p = 0.003) or to nCMAg (p = 0.006).

CONCLUSIONS: (1) 82{\%} of patients with limbic encephalitis prospectively identified on clinical grounds had CNS antibodies; (2) responsiveness to treatment is not limited to patients with VGKC antibodies; (3) in many patients (29{\%} from a single institution), the autoantigens were unknown but were found to be highly enriched in neuronal cell membranes of the hippocampus; and (4) these antibodies are associated with a favourable outcome.},

abstract = {There is now some evidence that major depression is accompanied by activation of the inflammatory response system. There is also some evidence that antidepressants may suppress the release of cytokines, such as interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and IL-6 by activated monocytes and IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN gamma) by activated T cells. This study was carried out to examine the effects of clomipramine, sertraline, and trazodone on the stimulated production of IFN gamma, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, and IL-10, a negative immunoregulatory cytokine. Whole blood of nine healthy volunteers was stimulated with PHA, 5 micrograms/mL and LPS, 25 micrograms/mL for 72 hr with and without incubation with clomipramine, 10(-6) and 10(-9) M, sertraline, 10(-6) and 10(-8) M, and trazodone, 10(-6) and 10(-8) M. All three antidepressants significantly reduced IFN gamma secretion, whereas clomipramine and sertraline significantly increased IL-10 secretion in culture supernatant. All three antidepressants significantly reduced the IFN gamma/IL-10 ratio. The results suggest that antidepressants, at concentrations in the therapeutical range, have negative immunoregulatory effects through inhibition of IFN gamma and stimulation of IL-10 release.},

abstract = {The potential contribution of chronic inflammation to the development of neuropsychiatric disorders such as major depression has received increasing attention. Elevated biomarkers of inflammation, including inflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins, have been found in depressed patients, and administration of inflammatory stimuli has been associated with the development of depressive symptoms. Data also have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokines can interact with multiple pathways known to be involved in the development of depression, including monoamine metabolism, neuroendocrine function, synaptic plasticity, and neurocircuits relevant to mood regulation. Further understanding of mechanisms by which cytokines alter behavior have revealed a host of pharmacologic targets that may be unique to the impact of inflammation on behavior and may be especially relevant to the treatment and prevention of depression in patients with evidence of increased inflammation. Such targets include the inflammatory signaling pathways cyclooxygenase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and nuclear factor-$\kappa$B, as well as the metabolic enzyme, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase, which breaks down tryptophan into kynurenine. Other targets include the cytokines themselves in addition to chemokines, which attract inflammatory cells from the periphery to the brain. Psychosocial stress, diet, obesity, a leaky gut, and an imbalance between regulatory and pro-inflammatory T cells also contribute to inflammation and may serve as a focus for preventative strategies relevant to both the development of depression and its recurrence. Taken together, identification of mechanisms by which cytokines influence behavior may reveal a panoply of personalized treatment options that target the unique contributions of the immune system to depression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To carry out a systematic review of the risk factors for, and incidence of, major depressive episode (MDE) related to antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C.

DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cochrane databases were searched to locate articles published from the earliest available online year until June 2011 using the keywords hepatitis C, interferon-alpha, peginterferon, pegylated interferon, depression, and mood and Boolean operators. Articles written in English, Spanish, and French were included.

STUDY SELECTION: Prospective studies reporting incidence of interferon-alpha-induced MDE were included. At baseline, patients did not present a DSM-IV/ICD depressive episode, and evaluation was performed by a trained clinician. Twenty-six observational studies met the inclusion criteria.

DATA EXTRACTION: Extracted data included authors, year of publication, design, characteristics of the population, viral coinfection, adjunctive psychopharmacology, instruments to assess depression, dose and type of interferon-alpha, adjunctive ribavirin treatment, and follow-up time. Outcome of incidence of MDE (primary outcome measure) was abstracted, as were potential predictive variables.

DATA SYNTHESIS: A full review was performed. Meta-analysis of the cumulative incidence of induced MDE as a function of time was carried out. Odds ratios (ORs) and mean differences were used to estimate the strength of association of variables.

RESULTS: Overall cumulative incidence of depression was 0.25 (95{\%} CI, 0.16 to 0.35) and 0.28 (95{\%} CI, 0.17 to 0.42) at 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, respectively. According to our analysis, high baseline levels of interleukin 6 (mean difference = 1.81; 95{\%} CI, 1.09 to 2.52), female gender (OR = 1.40; 95{\%} CI, 1.02 to 1.91), history of MDE (OR = 3.96; 95{\%} CI, 2.52 to 6.21), history of psychiatric disorder (OR = 3.18; 95{\%} CI, 1.60 to 6.32), subthreshold depressive symptoms (mean difference = 0.96; 95{\%} CI, 0.31 to 1.61), and low educational level (mean difference = -0.99; 95{\%} CI, -1.59 to -0.39) were predictive variables of MDE during antiviral treatment.

CONCLUSIONS: One in 4 chronic hepatitis C patients who start interferon and ribavirin treatment will develop an induced major depressive episode. Clinicians should attempt a full evaluation of patients before starting antiviral treatment in order to identify those at risk of developing interferon-induced depression.},

Cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for sleep disturbance and reduces inflammation experienced by peritoneal dialysis patients; however, this has not been studied in hemodialysis patients. To determine whether alleviation of sleep disturbance in hemodialysis patients also leads to less inflammation, we conducted a randomized controlled interventional study of 72 sleep-disturbed hemodialysis patients. Within this patient cohort, 37 received tri-weekly cognitive-behavioral therapy lasting 6 weeks and the remaining 35, who received sleep hygiene education, served as controls. The adjusted post-trial primary outcome scores of the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the Beck Anxiety Inventory were all significantly improved from baseline by therapy compared with the control group. The post-trial secondary outcomes of high-sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-18, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein levels significantly declined with cognitive-behavioral therapy in comparison with the control group. Thus, our results suggest that cognitive-behavioral therapy is effective for correcting disorganized sleep patterns, and for reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in hemodialysis patients.},

A brief overview of biological injury processes that impinge on the aging brain is provided, and their overall effect on the integrity of neural architecture is described. Cognitive decline associated with aging, and white matter connectivity degradation as a biological substrate for that decline, is then described. We then briefly describe the technology of DTI as a means for in vivo, non-invasive interrogation of white matter connectivity, and relate it to FLAIR, a more traditional MRI method for assessing white matter injury. We then survey the existing findings on relationships between aging-associated neuropathological processes and DTI measurements on one hand; and relationships between DTI measurements and late-life cognitive function on the other. We conclude with a summary of current research directions in relation to DTI studies of cognitive aging.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obsessions and compulsions may occur in the post-streptococcal disorders Sydenham's chorea and paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus (PANDAS). The proposed mediators are anti-basal ganglia antibodies (ABGA).

AIMS: We tested the hypothesis that post-streptococcal autoimmunity may have a role in'idiopathic'obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

METHOD: We examined 50 children with OCD for ABGA using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western immunoblotting. The findings were compared with paediatric autoimmune (n=50), neurological (n=100) and streptococcal (n=40) controls.

RESULTS: The mean ABGA binding on ABGA binding on ELISA was elevated in the patient cohort compared with all control groups (P{\textless}0.005 in all comparisons). Western immunoblotting revealed positive antibody binding (as seen in Sydenham's chorea) in 42{\%} of the patient cohort compared with 2-10{\%} of control groups (P{\textless}0.001 in all comparisons).

CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that central nervous system autoimmunity may have a role in a significant subgroup of cases of OCD. Further study is required to examine whether the antibodies concerned are pathogenic.},

@article{Najjar2013,
abstract = {Multiple lines of evidence support the pathogenic role of neuroinflammation in psychiatric illness. While systemic autoimmune diseases are well-documented causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, synaptic autoimmune encephalitides with psychotic symptoms often go under-recognized. Parallel to the link between psychiatric symptoms and autoimmunity in autoimmune diseases, neuroimmunological abnormalities occur in classical psychiatric disorders (for example, major depressive, bipolar, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorders). Investigations into the pathophysiology of these conditions traditionally stressed dysregulation of the glutamatergic and monoaminergic systems, but the mechanisms causing these neurotransmitter abnormalities remained elusive. We review the link between autoimmunity and neuropsychiatric disorders, and the human and experimental evidence supporting the pathogenic role of neuroinflammation in selected classical psychiatric disorders. Understanding how psychosocial, genetic, immunological and neurotransmitter systems interact can reveal pathogenic clues and help target new preventive and symptomatic therapies.},

@article{Miller2016,
abstract = {Crosstalk between inflammatory pathways and neurocircuits in the brain can lead to behavioural responses, such as avoidance and alarm, that are likely to have provided early humans with an evolutionary advantage in their interactions with pathogens and predators. However, in modern times, such interactions between inflammation and the brain appear to drive the development of depression and may contribute to non-responsiveness to current antidepressant therapies. Recent data have elucidated the mechanisms by which the innate and adaptive immune systems interact with neurotransmitters and neurocircuits to influence the risk for depression. Here, we detail our current understanding of these pathways and discuss the therapeutic potential of targeting the immune system to treat depression.},

@article{Cattaneo2013,
abstract = {To improve the 'personalized-medicine' approach to the treatment of depression, we need to identify biomarkers that, assessed before starting treatment, predict future response to antidepressants ('predictors'), as well as biomarkers that are targeted by antidepressants and change longitudinally during the treatment ('targets'). In this study, we tested the leukocyte mRNA expression levels of genes belonging to glucocorticoid receptor (GR) function (FKBP-4, FKBP-5, and GR), inflammation (interleukin (IL)-1$\alpha$, IL-1$\beta$, IL-4, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-10, macrophage inhibiting factor (MIF), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-$\alpha$), and neuroplasticity (brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), p11 and VGF), in healthy controls (n=34) and depressed patients (n=74), before and after 8 weeks of treatment with escitalopram or nortriptyline, as part of the Genome-based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression study. Non-responders had higher baseline mRNA levels of IL-1$\beta$ (+33{\%}), MIF (+48{\%}), and TNF-$\alpha$ (+39{\%}). Antidepressants reduced the levels of IL-1$\beta$ (-6{\%}) and MIF (-24{\%}), and increased the levels of GR (+5{\%}) and p11 (+8{\%}), but these changes were not associated with treatment response. In contrast, successful antidepressant response was associated with a reduction in the levels of IL-6 (-9{\%}) and of FKBP5 (-11{\%}), and with an increase in the levels of BDNF (+48{\%}) and VGF (+20{\%})-that is, response was associated with changes in genes that did not predict, at the baseline, the response. Our findings indicate a dissociation between 'predictors' and 'targets' of antidepressant responders. Indeed, while higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines predict lack of future response to antidepressants, changes in inflammation associated with antidepressant response are not reflected by all cytokines at the same time. In contrast, modulation of the GR complex and of neuroplasticity is needed to observe a therapeutic antidepressant effect.},

@article{Reichenberg2001,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Infectious, autoimmune, and neurodegenerative diseases are associated with profound psychological disturbances. Studies in animals clearly demonstrate that cytokines mediate illness-associated behavioral changes. However, the mechanisms underlying the respective psychological alterations in humans have not been established yet. Therefore, we investigated the effects of low-dose endotoxemia, a well-established and safe model of host-defense activation, on emotional, cognitive, immunological, and endocrine parameters. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover study, 20 healthy male volunteers completed psychological questionnaires and neuropsychological tests 1, 3, and 9 hours after intravenous injection of Salmonella abortus equi endotoxin (0.8 ng/kg) or saline in 2 experimental sessions. Blood samples were collected hourly, and rectal temperature and heart rate were monitored continuously. RESULTS: Endotoxin had no effects on physical sickness symptoms, blood pressure, or heart rate. Endotoxin caused a mild increase in rectal temperature (0.5 degrees C), and increased the circulating levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), soluble TNF receptors, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and cortisol. After endotoxin administration, the subjects showed a transient significant increase in the levels of anxiety (effect size [ES] = 0.55) and depressed mood (ES = 0.66). Verbal and nonverbal memory functions were significantly decreased (ES = 0.55 to 0.64). Significant positive correlations were found between cytokine secretion and endotoxin-induced anxiety (r = 0.49 to r = 0.60), depressed mood (r = 0.40 to r = 0.75), and decreases in memory performance (r = 0.46 to r = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: In humans, a mild stimulation of the primary host defense has negative effects on emotional and memory functions, which are probably caused by cytokine release. Hence, cytokines represent a novel target for neuropsychopharmacological research.},

@article{Goldsmith2016,
abstract = {Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depressive disorder (MDD) have all been associated with aberrant blood cytokine levels; however, neither the pattern of cytokine alterations nor the impact of clinical status have been compared across disorders. We performed a meta-analysis of blood cytokines in acutely and chronically ill patients with these major psychiatric disorders. Articles were identified by searching the PubMed, PsycInfo and Web of Science, and the reference lists of these studies. Sixty-eight studies met the inclusion criteria (40 schizophrenia, 10 bipolar disorder and 18 MDD) for acutely ill patients. Forty-six studies met the inclusion criteria (18 schizophrenia, 16 bipolar disorder and 12 MDD) for chronically ill patients. Levels of two cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-$\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$)), one soluble cytokine receptor (sIL-2R), and one cytokine receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) were significantly increased in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia, bipolar mania and MDD compared with controls (P{\textless}0.01). Following treatment of the acute illness, IL-6 levels significantly decreased in both schizophrenia and MDD (P{\textless}0.01); sIL-2R levels increased in schizophrenia; and IL-1RA levels in bipolar mania decreased. In chronically ill patients, the levels of IL-6 were significantly increased in schizophrenia, euthymic (but not depressed) bipolar disorder and MDD compared with controls (P{\textless}0.01). The levels of IL-1$\beta$ and sIL-2R were significantly increased in both chronic schizophrenia and euthymic bipolar disorder. Overall, there were similarities in the pattern of cytokine alterations in schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and MDD during acute and chronic phases of illness, raising the possibility of common underlying pathways for immune dysfunction. Effects of treatment on cytokines were more robust for schizophrenia and MDD, but were more frequently studied than for acute mania. These findings have important implications for our understanding of the pathophysiology and treatment of major psychiatric disorders.Molecular Psychiatry advance online publication, 23 February 2016; doi:10.1038/mp.2016.3.},
